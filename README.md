![Title Image](img/po.png)

### Quick Note
If you are absolutely brand new to Python, check out the sugggested links on the PyLadies meetup details:<br>

You'll still be able to follow along so no worries :)

### Objectives

By the end of this tutorial, you'll be able to:

- install Anaconda
- launch, run, and modify a Jupyter notebook
- use Python and Pandas to analyse a dataset of Hotel Receipts

## Setup Instructions

The follwing instructions assume that you have little to no experience using GitHub or Jupyter. In that case, you are probably viewing this document on [GitHub.com](https://github.com/). That's fine for *viewing* purposes, but if you want to be able to *run* the code in this document, you'll have to do some extra work. See the instructions below:

__Prep your computer:__

1. Install Anaconda (if you haven't already). See: https://www.continuum.io/downloads
1. Download our starter code:
    1. Go to https://github.com/turboquant/kungfu
    2. Click "Download ZIP".
    3. Save and unzip the file (and take note of where you saved it).

__Load our starter code using Jupyter:__

1. Launch Jupyter. There are two ways to do this:
    1. If you're confortable in the terminal, run the command `jupyter notebook`
    2. Otherwise, use `Anaconda Navigator` to launch Jupyter.
2. Using the Jupyter window that opens in your browser, navigate to where you saved & unzipped the starter code.
3. Click on THIS notebook to open it. You should now see this notebook on your own computer screen!

__Begin Programming!__

Congrats! You are now ready to run the code in this notebook! Continue by reading every English sentence in the notebook and running every cell of code.
